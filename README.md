# Entangled Errors

A collection of experiments, simulations, and side projects exploring **computational physics, data science, and algorithms**.  
The goal is to build a sandbox of ideas — messy, experimental, and educational.

---

## Listed Experiments
- **Monte Carlo π Estimation**  
  Randomly samples points inside a square to approximate the value of π.  
  *(Located in `experiments/montecarlo_pi/`)*

---

## Planned Additions
- Random walk simulations  
- Particle diffusion models  
- Small quantum-inspired experiments  
- Miscellaneous coding explorations

---

## Requirements
Most experiments use Python. Common dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy` *(for some future experiments)*

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
